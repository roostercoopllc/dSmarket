# dSmarket - The Decentralized Smart Contract Market Place: Polygon Blockchain

## Inspiration
Let's be honest. Even with the constant discussion on how blockchain decentralizes control and gives the individual control of their assets, and thus their lives. There are really only 3 different types of dApps that seem to even get created: DeFi, Videogames, or NFT art galleries. The users of these dApps are generally already believers of crypto currency, and have financial resources to fully participate in the #cryptolife or even have the time to understand how a decentralized future would ultimately benefit both sellers and customer. There will be continued resistance, or even governing backlash without this grassroots involvement in the 

This dApp's concept is not revolutionary. However, the advantages, and implementation of the app in an independant, distributed and decentralized manner truly is. Simply put the dApp is market place infrastructure to coordinate requested services with service providers through the most beneficial part blockchain technologies: Smart Contracts.

In the words of Vitalik Buterin:
```md
Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.
```

With this philosophy in mind, the dSmarketPlace market place allows contractors to select Gigs (like traditional gig economy) but for all types of services instead of . The smart contract infrastructure provides tangable, independantly auditable legal agreements between a person requiring work to be performed (a service requestor) and anyone that is able to provide the solution to that work at an acceptable. 

## What it does
The app facilitates 4 major components of the ecosystem. 
1. A Job MarketPlace
2. Profiles and history for both Contractors (People doing work) and Solicitors (People Wanting Work).
3. Rating Job Performance and Dispute Reconciliation Support by having a self notarizing negotiations and Completion history 
4. Facilitating directions to crypto exchanges to buy, exchange, or manage your crypto through the MetaMask connector.

### Examples of Jobs supported
1. ```Currier Service```: A simple job of taking a package across town. Utilizing the system of Profiles (of both sender and )
2. ```Unique tasks for people trying to transition career fields```: Allows for job history of individuals to be tracked and also used as a resume builder by individuals who want to work outside of traditional employment paradigms 
3. ```Ratings for non-industry specific work```: Allows for people with parallel backgrounds to perform side job tasks that would otherwise require extensive background or references.

### FAQs: 
1. How would I accept work from a specific contractor? (Profiles and Reviews)
2. Does this remove anonymity of blockchain? (No, you can create profiles and should realistically)
3. Does this replace apps that are currently in the same space? (No, in fact it allows them to talk to each other and lower cost by lowering their backend system O&M)
4. So then how does the app make money? (It doesn't make interacting the technology easier, instead the apps now compete on the user experience; applications can still collect data on the users, and tailored services for making certain jobs pop over others becomes comparative advantages)

### Smart Contracts
For the sake of speed and development, I put everything on the same network, but would definitely change this after some intensive testing to see what the best values are for transaction costs.
